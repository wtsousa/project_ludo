Ludo Simulator for Statistical Analysis based on Logistic Regression

This project contains three Python files:

- Ludo.py: Script to create data samples related to Ludo game matches simulations
- Ludo_Functions.py: Supporting functions to make code clearer to read
- Ludo_Stats.py: Script to wrangle data and analyze results based on Logistic Regression

The conclusion of the analysis for a general audience (in portuguese) is available at https://abcdocinema.com.br/diversao/o-gambito-da-rainha-como-ganhar-no-xadrez-e-no-ludo/
